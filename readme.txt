<strong>Why Need WP On-Page SEO Plugin?</strong>

1. You may be relatively new to Search Engine Optimization and you don't know exactly how to optimize your posts for search engines like Google.

2. Even if you do know that your posts and pages should be optimized for the search engines, you never really do it. There are just too many details like "include the keyword in the title, URL, alt tag of images etc." Imagine doing this for 10s or 100ds of posts and pages. It would take weeks! Even if your content is great, it will never attract the traffic it deserves, if it's not properly optimized. If you optimize your posts better than your competitors, you have a better chance of getting higher rankings and traffic.
